globusator: globe stripes generator
-----------------------------------

Usage: ./slize.pl [--option arg] [--option arg] infile.jpg

Some options can be found in the source code, most notably:
	--outprefix $prefix	Stripes will be named like $prefix-42.jpg.
	--height 3600		Length of the stripes, in pixels.
	--stripes 12		Number of the stripes.
	--quality 95		JPEG quality.

Dependencies:
	imagemagic: mogrify
	panotools : nona
	identify  : identify

Arguably the best results can be achieved with almost square (or round)
input images -- you'll find out, anyway.
